# Level 1 Task 7 -Beginner control structures: While and for loops

## NOTE - MISTAKES OF USING VAR WAS STILL MADE AT THIS POINT WHEN I SUBMITTED THE TASK

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a new JavaScript file called swapping.js.

● Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of at least 3 digits.

● Make use of a for loop to swap the second digit and last digit in the
number

● Output the original number and the new number.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user. If you need a refresher on how to do this, go back to the example.js
and index.html files in your Task 2 folder for a refresher.

● Create a JavaScript file called palindrome.js.

● Write a program that asks the user to enter a word.

● Using a while loop the program must determine whether or not the word
is a palindrome, ie. whether it reads the same forwards and backwards,
e.g. the word “racecar”.

● Output the given word and whether or not it is a palindrome.

● E.g. “racecar is a palindrome”

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a new file called while.js.

● Write a program that always asks the user to enter a number.

● When the user enters -1, the program should stop requesting the user to
enter a number,

● The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered,
excluding the -1.

● Make use of the while loop repetition structure to implement the
program.

● Compile, save and run your file.

## Task 4

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a JavaScript file in this folder called quiz.js.

● Create a do-while loop in which you ask the user a multiple choice
question. If they choose the incorrect answer, they are asked if they want
to try again, at which point they are asked the question again. The
program ends when the user either guesses correctly, or they do not wish
to guess again.

● Here is an example of the possible output:
What colour is the sky?

a. Purple

b. Pink

c. Blue

d. Yellow

Enter a, b, c or d: [user enters b]

This’s incorrect! Would you like to try again? y/n: [user enters
y]

[Question is asked again. User enters c]

That’s correct! [Program exits]
